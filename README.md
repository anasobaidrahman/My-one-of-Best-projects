# Use and Instructions to run these projects
These all projects are developed by python, So there is a need of installation of python to run these projects.And also all these projects are only terminal version and tested on IDE.

# Zombie Game Simulation

A simple Python-based simulation using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), featuring a player and zombie-like enemies with health, lives, and attack mechanics.

## 👾 Game Features

- `Enemy` class with hit points and lives
- `Brain_eater`: can randomly dodge attacks
- `king_Brain_eater`: stronger enemy with reduced damage taken
- `Player`: has lives, levels, and score system
- Demonstrates encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism

## 🕹️ How to Play

The game is run in the terminal. A loop attacks the `king_Brain_eater` until all lives are lost.

### Run the Game:

python main.py
## Concepts Used
OOP Principles (Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism)

Randomization (enemy ducking logic)

Time measurement using time module

Private attributes and property setters/getters

📂 File Structure

# BMI Calculator – Python Project
This is a simple BMI (Body Mass Index) calculator written in Python. It allows users to input their weight (in kilograms) and height (in meters), and then calculates the BMI to determine the health category of the individual.

## Features
Accepts user input for weight and height

Calculates BMI using the standard formula

Provides health advice based on BMI value

## Categorizes BMI as:

Underweight

Healthy

Overweight

Obese
 
## Sample Output

This is BMI software
Enter weight in kg : 70
Enter height in meters : 1.75
healthy
Good! You have to hold this health.
## How to Run
💡 You need Python 3 installed on your system.

Save the code in a file named bmi_calculator.py

Open a terminal and navigate to the file location

Run the script with:

python bmi_calculator.py
🛠️ Technologies Used
Python 3

## 📌 Future Improvements (Optional)
GUI version using Tkinter or PyQt

Store BMI records for multiple users

Add unit conversion (lbs/ft to kg/m

# 🎯 Number Guessing Game – Python Project
This is a beginner-friendly Number Guessing Game built using Python. The program generates a random number between 1 and 10, and the user has a total of 5 attempts to guess it correctly.

## 🚀 Features
Generates a random number between 1 and 10 each round

Accepts user input for guessing

Informs the user if the guess was correct or not

Allows up to 5 attempts

Gives motivational messages after each round

## 🧠 How It Works
The program starts a loop with 5 attempts.

On each attempt:

A random number (1–10) is generated.

The user guesses a number.

The program compares both numbers and outputs the result.

The game continues until all 5 attempts are used.

## 🖥️ Sample Output

Guess number between 1 to 10: 7
Computer thinked: 3
you lost this turn
make another one try

Guess number between 1 to 10: 5
Computer thinked: 5
Nice! you won the game
you guessed correct
## 🔧 How to Run
💡 Make sure Python 3 is installed on your system.

Save the code as number_guessing_game.py

Open terminal/command prompt

Run the file:
python number_guessing_game.py
🛠️ Technologies Used
Python 3

random module

## 📌 Possible Enhancements
Keep track of total score or correct guesses

Add difficulty levels (e.g., Easy: 1–10, Hard: 1–50)

GUI version using Tkinter

Multiplayer mode
